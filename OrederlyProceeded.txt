As a Taiwanese, I would say this is laughable. 
Most of the items described are ranging from heavily over-exaggerated to ludicrously none existence. 
- Air force: Missiles will take out not just air field, suitable highway, but also most of the plane bunker entrance. Not one will be able to take off.
- Navy: Lacking formal amphibious assault ship for mainland is true, but other type of ships out number Taiwan tremendously, and those "four submarines" are outdated module which can be easily detected from sea bed sonar array. Good luck deploying sea mine when no ship from Taiwan dare to sail. For supply part, 
Penghu island is basically defenseless, so the crossing actually takes only 50km.
- Army: What do you think military engineering vehicles and drones is used for? Decoration? The landing won't be smooth, but modern technology is on mainland's side. And don't mention the training our soldiers get, or the cold war relic they use, the corruption inside our army is outrageous. Young folks rather stay unemployed than been listed. 
- Behind the line operation: Trust me, our rank is infiltrated so hard, once they leave the island, they no longer follow order, DPP's control is weak.  
- US support: Good luck with that. With the response time of US nowadays and the A2AD strategy fully deployed, no meaningful support will arrive in time. 
- Morale: 50% of export and all GPD growth depends on mainland, millions of population work/live across the stride, DPP itself rely on doing business with mainland, or why don't they revoke ECFA, the very treaty which lead to the winning of DPP in major election? They beg china maintain ECFA this very treaty they vowed to scrap in the first place.
- Missile: This is the only slightest accurate part, our missile systems are pretty good. The problem is they are not very mobile, and most of their deployed locations are well researched by mainland. Fix that, and we might have a show to watch. 
Don't get me wrong, Taiwan will make mainland pay harshly if they want to do the hard way. Every Taiwanese killed will take ten mainlanders with them, mainland will destroy their army here and will never raise another in ten years, which they don't have if they want to counter US.
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting, so the unification shall be "orderly" proceeded. Choose wisely.
